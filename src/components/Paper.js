            The CIC 2016 organisers regard plagiarism as a serious professional misconduct. All submissions will be screened for plagiarism and when identified, the submission by the same author will be rejected. A submission SHOULD NOT be intended to get reviews from the program committee for the sole purpose of improving on the quality of paper. A submission implies that the author intends to ultimately register the paper upon a favourable response from the conference organisers. Moreover CIC 2016 does not encourage withdrawals after the paper is accepted.
